Canidae (dogs, foxes, and their closest relatives) is one of the few groups in the tree of life for which both the modern diversity and fossil record are well-sampled. Thus, building a complete dated phylogeny of canids can provide paleobiologists the rare opportunity of studying complex biodiversity questions using both a robust phylogeny and a look into the past in the form of fossil data. Methods of inference for phylogenies often clash with the way paleontological dated are traditionally encoded, however. The stratigraphic-range fossilized birth-death (SRFBD) process is a model that fits the intricacies of the fossil record, better accommodating the way systematics is carried out in the study of extinct species. Here we present the first full application of SRFBD by inferring the most complete phylogenetic tree for canids to date. We also compare this tree with those inferred by traditional models to investigate the effects of different data on species relationships and divergence times. This will deepen our understanding of the limitations and features of these models, and better inform future studies attempting to work on the interface between systematics, macroevolution, and paleontology.
